Code for BBS fluctuation analysis

BBS.r contains a master .r script for full analysis of the BBS fluctuations.  To run, it requires data stored in BBS/weather.csv as well as the state-level .csv files stored in BBS/State-level data compilation/

Deleting or renaming any of these files will break BBS.r

As of September 22, all other files and scripts are probably superfluous (though they were insturmental in pulling together the code that now sites in BBS.r).
